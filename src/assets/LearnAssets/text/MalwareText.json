    "virus": {
        "description": "A virus is malicious code that attaches itself to an application. Once the application is run, the code is executed and runs as well. Viruses are programmatically designed to find other applications to replicate itself. Most times, viruses stay dormant and replicate before delivering its malicious payload. Viruses all have different intentions, some may install adware, others might delete or modify files, some may slow processes, or even just monitor for information going in or out of the network.",
        "example": "The File Infector Virus is a virus that embeds malicious code into a devices executable files (which are the files a system uses to operate) like PDFs, Word Docs, games, etc. Once embedded, this virus tries to spread to other executable files and sometimes to the network.",
        "mitigation": "One of the best ways of preventing viruses from being downloaded is having an updated anti-virus. Another important practice to prevent a virus is to not click suspicious links. This also includes email attachments and instant message attachments that have viruses. Also, never download suspicious attachments/files and avoid pirating as those might have viruses in them."
    },
    "worms": {
        "description": "A worm is self-replicating malware that traverses throughout a network without the support of an application or user interaction. A worm lives in memory and can use many different transport protocols to traverse over the network. Each infected system tries to locate and infect other systems on the network. This causes network performance issues as it takes a lot of bandwidth. Worms can come from different sources like a vulnerability on a software or operating system, or through an email, instant message, etc.",
        "example": " A real-life example of a worm is the ILOVEYOU worm. This worm was an email with the subject “ILOVEYOU”, and a malicious attachment was included that was meant to look like a document, but was actually a Visual Basic script. After opening the attachment, the script would overwrite and modify files. It would also replicate and send this email over and over through the email contact list of infected systems. ",
        "mitigation": "One way to prevent a worm from infecting your computer is by not clicking any suspicious links or downloading any attachments. Monitor the device's hard drive and memory as when worms try to replicate, it uses free space. Monitor network and bandwidth as the worm can replicate over the network and this uses bandwidth that can be logged. Monitor the performance and speed of the device and look for any suspicious or modified files. "

    "logicbombs": {
        "description": "A logic bomb is a string of code embedded into an application or script that will execute in response to either an event or a set time. Logic bombs can be very dangerous to internal systems, and it is important to also be aware of insider threats.",
        "example": "A disgruntled ex-employee that created software that went off after he was terminated. This piece of software was delivered to a co-worker via email and was installed. It’s intent is to see if her account has been deleted or if her name is taken off payroll. After the software triggers, it causes a DoS to the organization’s main infrastructure.",
        "mitigation": "One way of preventing logic bombs is by keeping your antivirus updated and all software updated as many logic bombs are embedded in code. Monitor activities of employees and a closer inspection of employees that have higher access like admin privileges. It also helps using the Least Privilege Access principle. Logic Bombs can also come with pirated software so avoid installation of suspicious and pirated software. Another important factor in preventing logic bombs is by attempting to keep all current and past workers happy and satisfied to avoid insider logic bombs."
    },
    "backdoor": {
        "description": "A backdoor provides an alternative way of accessing a system. Malicious backdoors are usually embedded into code to bypass authentication and secure a remote connection. While software developers often code backdoors into applications so they can quickly modify their code, this practice is not recommended. Hackers use backdoors to install many types of malware to further infect the device. Backdoors can also come from inside the organization with a disgruntled employee that can insert a backdoor, and maliciously use it if they feel like they have been wronged.",
        "example": "A real-life example of a backdoor being used is Autolt backdoor. This backdoor was used for the MONSOON campaign and would attempt multiple different malicious tactics. It would connect to an outside command-and-control server to initiate remote connection. It would also attempt to bypass User Access Controls and gain more privileges. ",
        "mitigation": "One way to prevent backdoors is by following the recommending practice of not creating backdoors in general. Other ways to prevent backdoors is to have code reviews and have everyone accountable/keep logs of who did what. Using the Least Privilege practice, and immediately removing an ex-employee access can also prevent backdoors. Regarding backdoors from the outside, it is important to keep all software and anti-virus updated. "

    "trojans": {
        "description": "A Trojan, also often called a Trojan horse, tricks the victim by concealing itself true intent. Trojan horses are named after the infamous horse from the Trojan War. A Trojan horse can come with anything that can be downloaded on a machine. Attackers are using the drive-by downloads technique more often to get trojans installed. In a drive-by download, servers try to install a program without the victim’s consent. Trojans are intended to look legitimate and can mirror any type of software. Rogueware is a type of trojan that attempts to trick its victim by telling them they have a virus on their machine. It then convinces them that they must pay for a fake anti-virus and that will install malware. Ransomware is another type of trojan that encrypts the user’s data and can lock out the user. After this, the attackers ask for ransom to be paid to unlock their devices.",
        "example": "One real life example of a trojan would be Zeus or Zbot. Zeus had many different uses and one of them made the attacker be able to use a keylogger on infected machines to grab any banking credentials to steal money out of the account. Zeus was spread through spam messages and drive-by-downloads.",
        "mitigation": "One of the main ways of preventing yourself from getting a trojan is to have a legitimate antivirus software downloaded on your device and kept up to date. It is important to be careful with all attachments that you receive and to never go to any suspicious links or website. It is also safe and good practice to keep your operating system up to date with new security patches."
    },
    "rats": {
        "description": "A remote access Trojan (RAT) is a malware that allows attackers to take control of systems remotely. Once a RAT is installed, attackers can access the infected device anytime, anywhere, and can even install other malwares. RATs can have many different functionalities, it can collect keystrokes, infect the network, steal credentials, modify files, and many more. It is common for attackers to infect the network that the infected machine is on quickly.",
        "example": "Sub7 is a RAT that was used that bypasses security techniques to gain control of a device or network secretly. There were many different functionalities that came with Sub7 that range from keylogging, to turning off monitors, to harming your device more. ",
        "mitigation": "It is possible to remediate any RATs on your machine by installing an anti-virus and keeping it up to date. It is also very important to not click on suspicious links and do not install suspicious software. RATs are usually targeted at the financial industry, governments, and organizations since creating a good RAT takes money and time. "
    },
    "keylogger": {
        "description": "A keylogger is either a computer software or hardware that logs keystrokes on an infected machine. Many attackers use keyloggers to steal credentials for more malicious purposes like gaining admin privileges or stealing bank credentials for money. Keyloggers can be modified in many ways. It can automatically send the recorded keystrokes to the attacker or the attacker can manually send the records. Physical hardware like USB keyloggers exist so it is important to be aware of insider threats for this type of malware.",
        "example": "EvilCrow is an example of a physical keylogger that can be purchased online for less than $10 that even has a MicroSD card slot. ",
        "mitigation": "Keeping antivirus updated on your device can detect keyloggers or activities of such. A victim can also monitor their device's activity and processes that occur. There is some anti-keylogging software out there that can be installed and kept up to date. In a business situation, a company can set policies that permit its employees from plugging any external hardware into their machines. Another practice that is not as popular and favorable is using the onscreen keyboards."
    },
    "spyware": {
        "description": "Spyware is software that infects a device without its owners’ knowledge or consent. The main goal of spyware is to track and monitor the device's activities. They can contain keyloggers and steal a victim’s data usage, and private information on their hard drive. This is often downloaded by either drive-by-downloads, email attachments or unreliable sources, or even pirated software. This can cause your device to slow, or crash randomly. ",
        "example": "You accidentally type the name of your banking website's URL wrong and are taken to a page that looks similar to your bank's. Since it looks so similar, you don't think much of it, and begin attempting to log in. Once you click the Login button, a drive-by-download occurs, and a program is downloaded to your device. Since it comes from 'your bank', you attempt to install it. At first, it appears that nothing has happened. You assume the installation was broken and you ignore it, continuing about your day. In reality, however, spyware was installed on to your device. The program begins to monitor your activity - clicks, network traffic, audio, etc. You are soon sent tons of random ads for things related to your search history. Your device's performance is also significantly slower than before, and you are unable to detect the cause of this slowdown since the spyware is so well hidden. ",
        "mitigation": "It is important to monitor your hard drive capacity constantly. It is also a big hint if you keep receiving pop-ups whether you are online or offline, do not click on these. Keeping your antivirus up to date is critical, and make sure to not download anything suspicious or click on suspicious links. There are anti-spyware tools that exist for remediation. "
    },
    "adware": {
        "description": "Adware is software that is intended to display advertisements all over your device. Usually, these ads are trying to sell you something and it can be malicious or harmless. It becomes malicious if it is intentionally done with fake software or intended to slow down your machine. Most of the advertisements are pop-ups and it can be based on your recent search history. This is mostly inconvenient for the victims as it sets multiple roadblocks for just trying to use your device or surf the internet. Adware gets installed on systems by either visiting a website that is infected with adware, or from an open-source free software that secretly installs adware.",
        "example": "Kuik is an example of an adware that has different functionalities but mainly installs useless Google Chrome extensions.",
        "mitigation": "Updated anti-virus software can detect and remove adware if they have been installed. Browser ad blocks are also a good option when trying to remove advertisements. Be careful when installing free software even if it comes from a legitimate website. Avoid pirating and clicking on suspicious links or attachments."
    },
    "bots": {
        "description": "Bots stand for robots; they are infected machines that are controlled by an attacker. A Botnet stands for a bot network and it is a bunch of infected bots that are designed to perform tasks on command simultaneously for a malicious purpose. Zombies is another name for the infected machines. Attackers use botnets for different reasons; to steal credentials/private information, steal money, cause a denial of service. Attackers can also rent out or sell their botnets to other attackers.",
        "example": "Mirai is one of the most famous botnet attacks that is intended to infect the Internet of Things (which are ‘things’ that can be connected to the internet) and launch a denial of service.",
        "mitigation": "To prevent a botnet attack, keep your operating systems patched and your anti-virus software updated. Attackers usually infect IoTs when suspicious software or websites don’t have the proper security protections. So, make sure to watch your every click, and keep everything updated/monitored. "
    },
    "rootkit": {
        "description": "A rootkit is a collection of software that is intended to stay hidden on an infected device. There are different types of rootkits and they are one of the hardest pieces of malware to detect and remove. Rootkits usually hide either deep in systems operating systems (in the kernel), in the random-access memory (RAM), in the BIOS, or in an application. Rootkits have many different malicious purposes that range from stealing credentials, to modifying or deleting data and attackers can control machines remotely.",
        "example": "ZeroAccess is a kernel rootkit that infected millions of machines. This specific rootkit was able to stay hidden and install other malware that would infect the device and join it to a botnet for attackers to use.",
        "mitigation": "Since detecting rootkits is so hard, be careful on where you download software, what websites you go to, or what emails you get. Keeping your anti-virus and operating systems are also good practice. Monitor your device's performance and memory. Usually when harmful rootkits come out, tools are then created that are intended to remove that certain rootkit."
