    Description: 
        - ParticleJS is a lightweight, open-source Javascript Library for creating particle animations 
        - You can learn more / download ParticleJS here: https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/
        - Our website uses react-particles-js, an NPM package that takes the functionality of "tsParticles" 
          (a fork of ParticlesJS) and converts it into a React component for ease-of-use in react projects
        - You can learn more about / download react-particles-js here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-particles-js

        - The ParticlesJS component takes an object of paramaters (as React props) that define the look and functionality 
          of the particles 
        - Most of our particle's configuration comes from one of ParticleJS' example pages, which you can find 
          here: https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/#nasa
        - The functionality has has its mouse interactivity stripped and the movement speed of the particles has been slowed down.
          to make them less distracting
